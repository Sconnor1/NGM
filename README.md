New Generation Merchandising

Project Leader: Shaughnessy Connor/n
Chief UI Designer: Daniel Choi 
Chief Database Administrator: Devin McRee
Chief Database Architect & Design: Hannah Navarrete

Our team was appointed to find an information system solution for New Generation Merchandising. 
Initially, New Generation Merchandising had no system in place to record, analyze, or manipulate sales data or inventory data. 
The company sought to implement a comprehensive, functional, and maneuverable information system. 	

Based on research conducted on necessary business operations and similar current, real-world information systems, 
the team determined that the use of a web-based solution. In which will allows individual satellite sites (kiosks) to maintain a location-based 
database and integrate this with a company-based database. It will be utilizing a personalized interface customizable for each level of access will 
satisfy the needs of the New Generation Merchandising.
